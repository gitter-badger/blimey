Abacus is a 3D maths library for the [CLI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure), built with a primary focus on performance and efficiency.  Abacus is ideal for use developing real-time 3D applications and deterministic network simulations.

Abacus provides the following data type:

* Vector2
* Vector3
* Vector4
* Matrix
* Quaternion

consistently across the following precisions:

* Single
* Double
* Fixed32

To use Abacus choose the precision you want to work with and include the corresponding Abacus.*.cs file in your project.
