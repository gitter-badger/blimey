This folder contains built resources in the .cba format (Cor Binary Asset).

.cba is Cor's own file format used for loading its resources, the format itself is fairly similar to XNA's .xnb format.

The contents of this folder can be generated by running:

    $ cab build

from the root directory of this repository (cab = cor asset builder).
